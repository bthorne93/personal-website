summary: I discuss work I did during my PhD to forecast the efficienty of Galactic foreground removal in future CMB experiments. 
abstract: "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has been an extremely successful probe of cosmic history, and has been pivotal in establishing the concordance cosmological model, Lambda-CDM. However, some fundamental questions still remain. For example, did a period of inflation seed the structure that we see in the Universe today? To answer this question, future CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory, South Pole Observatory, and CMB-S4, will make pristine measurements of the polarized CMB. Placing robust constraints on inflation using these observations will require precise modelling and removal of Galactic foregrounds, which dominate over the polarized CMB at all frequencies and in all areas of the sky. In this talk I will present forecasts for the performance of the Simons Observatory, show that mis-modelling spatial variation of Galactic foregrounds causes a spurious detection of inflation, and suggest some methods to mitigate such a bias. The fidelity of foreground simulations is limited by the available observations of polarized Galactic foregrounds. I will present current work to model the statistics of Galactic foregrounds with generative machine learning techniques.
